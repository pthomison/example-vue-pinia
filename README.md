# Example Project: [vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) + [pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org)

Pinia is a state management system for vue that handles the plumbing between state and all the components. This helps prevent spagetti code plumbing props && events between all the components to effectivly share data. Reducing clutter in the components allows you to only have semantically interesting arguments in your components.
